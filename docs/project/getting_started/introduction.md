This section steps through the HTC-Grid's AWS infrastructure and software prerequisites. An AWS account is required along with some limited familiarity of AWS services and terraform. The execution of the [Happy Path](#getting-started) section will create AWS resources not included in the free tier and then will incur cost to your AWS Account. The complete execution of this section will cost at least 50$ per day.
