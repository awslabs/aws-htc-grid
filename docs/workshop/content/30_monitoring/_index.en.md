In this section we will explore a few ways to monitor HTC-Grid using [Amazon CloudWach](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). We will check the logs generated and stored on the cluster components using [CloudWatch Container Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights.html)

Once that we check how to check this dashboards, we will submit a session with many tasks to scale up our cluster.
