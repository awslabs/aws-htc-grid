In this section we will deploy HTC-Grid and all the dependencies. By the end of this section we will have a full HTC-Grid deployment working.


## Getting Started
To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

* ...[running the workshop on your own (in your own account)]({{< relref "10_self_paced/_index.en.md" >}}), or
* ...[attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)]({{< relref "20_aws_event/_index.en.md" >}})

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with **[Configure your Workspace]({{< ref "20_deploy_htc/30_configure_your_workspace/_index.en.md" >}})**

In **Hugo**, pages are the core of your site. All of your workshop steps should be developed as pages.
